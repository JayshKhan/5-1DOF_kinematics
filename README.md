## Forward Kinematics

The forward kinematics of a robot is the method of calculating the Cartesian coordinates of the end-effector from the
joint angles of the robot. The forward kinematics of the ROT3U robotic arm is calculated using the Denavit-Hartenberg (
DH) parameters.

## Inverse Kinematics

The inverse kinematics of a robot is the method of calculating the joint angles of the robot from the Cartesian
coordinates of the end-effector. The inverse kinematics of the ROT3U robotic arm is calculated using the Geometric
method.

## Simulation

Still undecided on the simulation software to be used for the simulation of the ROT3U robotic arm.

## Hardware Implementation

The hardware implementation of the ROT3U robotic arm will be done using the following components:

- ROT3U Robotic Arm
    - 6 x Servo Motors
    - 1 x Arduino Uno
    - 1 x Power Supply
